* ClusterPoints.updateMarkersNeedingIcons - requests same marker multiple times. solution: Make markersNeedingIcons into a list of markers for each weight; when the icon arrives, update each marker in this list.
* add proper GWT logging
* make a slider to change the number of points
* ClusterMap should take a bounding box rather then a centre point
* UxPostalService should control for overlapping requests - i.e. prepareOutgoing() and actualSend() should
  either allow multiple parallel requests or wait or something if a request is in progress
* on click - map should pan , not jump
* make it more generic by removing or abstracting Blight Blog specific code
* DOM should only be parsed (and augmented) once
* in attachOnDemandUrl() - drag end and zoom should do a url fetch straight away; bounds changed should wait? or manual for jumps?
