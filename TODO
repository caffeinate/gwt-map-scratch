* I think MapMarkerClickEvent can be removed
* UxPostalService should control for overlapping requests - i.e. prepareOutgoing() and actualSend() should
  either allow multiple parallel requests or wait or something if a request is in progress
* on click - map should pan , not jump
* make it more generic by removing or abstracting Blight Blog specific code
* DOM should only be parsed (and augmented) once
* in attachOnDemandUrl() - drag end and zoom should do a url fetch straight away; bounds changed should wait? or manual for jumps?
* tiles should be able to set the bounding box that they exist for. i.e. browser shouldn't request tiles outside this bounding.
* move event classes into the packages that use them
* responsive mode shouldn't be a string but a constant which can be mappped to a string for CSS purposes
* ResponsiveSizing should also contain the responsive mode. They are currently being passed around separately.
* When you first load the map you can't click the map markers. workaround - move the map a tiny bit and then it will work.
* Uncoil.java is doing a lot of work. I think the front end should just be displaying what the back end gives it without too
  much interpretation. Changing the weight on a node means the icon assigned to the BasePoint (i.e. markerUrl) might not
  be valid any more.... so simplify how the front end places shapes on the map. If this is possible, remove markerURL from
  Nest, BasePoint etc.
